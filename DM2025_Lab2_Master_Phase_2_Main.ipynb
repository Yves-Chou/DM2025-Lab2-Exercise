This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n",

        "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
        "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
        "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
        "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
        "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n",

            "text/markdown": "Of course! Here is a comprehensive explanation of FinTech.\n\n### At its Core: A Simple Definition\n\n**FinTech**, short for **Financial Technology**, is any technology used to improve, automate, or disrupt traditional financial services.\n\nThink of it this way: FinTech is the engine behind why you can send money to a friend with an app, get a loan without ever stepping into a bank, or buy stocks from your phone for free.\n\n---\n\n### A Deeper Dive\n\nFinTech isn't just about startups trying to compete with big banks. It also includes established financial institutions and technology companies that are adopting new tech to improve their services. The ultimate goal is to make financial services more **accessible, efficient, and user-friendly** for both consumers and businesses.\n\nIt challenges the old way of doing things—long lines, complex paperwork, high fees, and 9-to-5 business hours—by putting the power of banking, investing, and payments directly into the user's hands, usually through a smartphone.\n\n---\n\n### Key Areas and Everyday Examples\n\nYou probably use FinTech every day without even realizing it. Here are the major categories with popular examples:\n\n#### 1. Digital Payments\nThis is the most common form of FinTech. It involves moving money electronically without physical cash or checks.\n*   **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Payments:** Apps that let you instantly send money to friends and family.\n    *   **Examples:** Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, Cash App\n*   **Mobile Wallets:** Storing your credit/debit card information on your phone for easy payments.\n    *   **Examples:** Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay\n\n#### 2. Digital Lending & Crowdfunding\nTechnology has transformed how individuals and businesses borrow money, often bypassing traditional banks.\n*   **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending:** Online platforms that match borrowers directly with individuals or groups willing to lend money.\n    *   **Examples:** LendingClub, Prosper\n*   **\"Buy Now, Pay Later\" (BNPL):** Services that let you purchase an item and pay for it in installments.\n    *   **Examples:** Klarna, Afterpay, Affirm\n*   **Crowdfunding:** Platforms that allow a large number of people to invest small amounts of money in a business or project.\n    *   **Examples:** Kickstarter, GoFundMe\n\n#### 3. Investing & Trading (Robo-Advisors)\nFinTech has democratized investing, making it accessible to everyone, not just the wealthy.\n*   **Robo-Advisors:** Automated, algorithm-driven platforms that build and manage an investment portfolio for you based on your goals and risk tolerance.\n    *   **Examples:** Betterment, Wealthfront\n*   **Commission-Free Trading:** Apps that allow you to buy and sell stocks, ETFs, and other assets with zero commission fees.\n    *   **Examples:** Robinhood, Fidelity, Charles Schwab (their app versions)\n\n#### 4. Personal Finance & Budgeting\nApps that help you track your spending, manage your budget, and improve your financial health.\n*   **Examples:** Mint, YNAB (You Need A Budget), Personal Capital\n\n#### 5. Digital Banking (Neobanks)\nThese are banks that operate entirely online, without any physical branches. They often offer lower fees and a better user experience through their mobile apps.\n*   **Examples:** Chime, Revolut, N26\n\n#### 6. Insurance (InsurTech)\nThis sub-field applies technology to the insurance industry to streamline claims, customize policies, and lower costs.\n*   **Examples:** Lemonade (uses AI to process claims in seconds), Root Insurance (bases car insurance rates on your driving behavior).\n\n#### 7. Cryptocurrency & Blockchain\nThis is one of the most disruptive areas of FinTech. Blockchain is the secure and decentralized ledger technology that powers cryptocurrencies.\n*   **Examples:** Bitcoin, Ethereum, and crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.\n\n---\n\n### Why is FinTech So Important?\n\n*   **Increased Convenience:** Access financial services 24/7 from anywhere.\n*   **Lower Costs:** Automation and reduced overhead (like no physical branches) often lead to lower fees for consumers.\n*   **Greater Accessibility (Financial Inclusion):** FinTech can provide essential financial services to people in underserved or remote areas who may not have access to a traditional bank.\n*   **Improved User Experience:** FinTech companies are laser-focused on creating simple, intuitive, and fast digital experiences.\n*   **Increased Competition:** The rise of FinTech has forced traditional banks to innovate and improve their own services to stay competitive.\n\n### The Technologies Driving FinTech\n\n*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning:** Used for credit scoring, fraud detection, customer service chatbots, and personalized financial advice.\n*   **Blockchain:** Provides a secure and transparent way to record transactions, powering cryptocurrencies and more.\n*   **Cloud Computing:** Allows FinTech companies to store vast amounts of data and scale their services quickly and affordably.\n*   **Mobile Technology:** The smartphone is the primary platform for delivering FinTech services to the masses.\n\n### In a Nutshell\n\nThink of what **Netflix did to Blockbuster** or what **Amazon did to traditional retail**. **FinTech is doing the same thing to traditional banking and finance.** It's using technology to offer a faster, cheaper, and more convenient alternative."

            "text/markdown": "Of course. As a FinTech expert, I'd be happy to break this down for you.\n\nLet's start with the simple definition and then explore the details.\n\n### The Simple Definition\n\n**FinTech**, short for \"Financial Technology,\" is any technology used to improve, automate, or disrupt traditional financial services.\n\nThink of it this way: FinTech is what happens when you apply the speed, convenience, and user-friendliness of the internet and smartphones to the world of banking, investing, and payments.\n\n### The Deeper Dive: What It Really Means\n\nFor decades, finance was dominated by large, slow-moving institutions: banks, insurance companies, and investment firms. You had to physically go to a branch, fill out paperwork, and deal with processes that hadn't changed much in 50 years.\n\nFinTech companies looked at this and asked, \"Why can't managing money be as easy as ordering a pizza or hailing a ride on your phone?\"\n\nThe core goal of FinTech is to make financial services:\n\n*   **More Accessible:** Allowing anyone with a smartphone to access services that were once exclusive or difficult to obtain (like investing or getting a loan).\n*   **More Efficient:** Automating manual processes to make things faster and reduce errors.\n*   **Less Expensive:** Cutting out middlemen and physical infrastructure (like bank branches) to lower fees for consumers.\n*   **More User-Friendly:** Designing intuitive apps and websites that focus on a great customer experience.\n\n---\n\n### Key Areas of FinTech (with Examples)\n\nFinTech isn't just one thing; it's a vast ecosystem covering many different areas. Here are the most important ones:\n\n#### 1. Digital Payments\nThis is the most common form of FinTech you use every day. It's about moving money without using cash or physical checks.\n*   **Examples:** **PayPal**, **Venmo**, **Stripe** (powers payments for millions of online businesses), **Apple Pay**, **Block (formerly Square)**.\n\n#### 2. Digital Lending\nOnline platforms that connect borrowers directly with lenders (or lend their own capital), using data and algorithms to make credit decisions in minutes, not weeks.\n*   **Examples:** **SoFi** (student loans, personal loans), **Klarna** and **Affirm** (Buy Now, Pay Later services), **Rocket Mortgage**.\n\n#### 3. Personal Finance & Wealth Management (\"WealthTech\")\nMaking investing and financial planning accessible to everyone, not just the wealthy. This includes robo-advisors that use algorithms to manage your investment portfolio for a very low fee.\n*   **Examples:** **Robinhood** (commission-free stock trading), **Betterment** and **Wealthfront** (robo-advisors), **Mint** (budgeting app), **Acorns** (micro-investing).\n\n#### 4. InsurTech\nUsing technology to modernize the insurance industry. This includes everything from using AI to process claims faster to using data from your smartphone to offer you a better car insurance rate.\n*   **Examples:** **Lemonade** (uses AI and chatbots for home and renters insurance), **Root Insurance** (bases car insurance rates on your actual driving behavior tracked via an app).\n\n#### 5. Blockchain & Cryptocurrency\nLeveraging decentralized, secure digital ledgers (blockchain) to create new financial assets and systems. This is the technology that powers Bitcoin, Ethereum, and thousands of other digital currencies.\n*   **Examples:** **Coinbase** (a platform to buy and sell crypto), **MetaMask** (a crypto wallet), **Circle** (issuer of the USDC stablecoin).\n\n#### 6. RegTech (Regulatory Technology)\nHelping financial companies comply with complex government regulations more efficiently and cheaply, often using AI to monitor for fraud and money laundering.\n*   **Examples:** **ComplyAdvantage**, **Chainalysis** (monitors blockchain transactions for illicit activity).\n\n#### 7. Embedded Finance & BaaS (Banking-as-a-Service)\nThis is a huge, emerging trend. It's the idea of putting a financial product inside a non-financial company's app or service. BaaS providers offer the back-end infrastructure that allows this to happen.\n*   **The Classic Example:** When you take an **Uber**, you pay for the ride seamlessly within the app. You don't pull out a credit card machine. That's embedded payments.\n*   **Other Examples:** **Shopify** offering loans and bank accounts directly to its merchants; an airline offering travel insurance at checkout.\n\n---\n\n### Why is FinTech Such a Big Deal?\n\nFinTech is fundamentally changing our relationship with money.\n\n1.  **Financial Inclusion:** It's bringing banking and investment services to people in underserved communities who may not have access to a traditional bank branch.\n2.  **Customer Empowerment:** It gives consumers more choice, transparency, and control over their finances than ever before.\n3.  **Disruption:** It's forcing traditional banks and financial institutions to innovate and improve their own services to compete, which is a win for everyone.\n4.  **Data-Driven Decisions:** FinTech uses vast amounts of data to create more personalized products, assess risk more accurately, and offer better advice.\n\nIn short, **FinTech is to finance what e-commerce was to retail.** It took an old, physical industry and rebuilt it for the digital age, putting the customer at the center of the experience."

              " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",

Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

This rule applies to various corporate decisions, such as mergers, acquisitions, product development, executive compensation, and strategic planning, providing directors with a \"safe harbor\" to make informed choices without the constant fear of personal liability. This, in turn, encourages a more proactive and entrepreneurial management style.\n\nHowever, the BJR is not absolute. A plaintiff can challenge its protection by providing evidence of:\n\n*   **Waste:** Decisions that result in the dissipation of corporate assets, like overpaying for goods or services, or excessive executive compensation.\n*   **Fraud:** Deceptive or misleading conduct intended to benefit the director or others at the corporation's or shareholders' expense.\n*   **Self-dealing:** Transactions where directors have a personal financial interest in the other party involved.\n*   **Gross negligence:** Failing to consider significant, easily discoverable facts that could negatively impact the corporation.\n\nIf a director is found to have engaged in any of these actions, they may be held personally liable for the resulting harm, potentially facing consequences such as monetary damages or disgorgement of profits."

For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

        "# The results show that there are 7 improved cases (about 17%), mostly labeled as fear and sadness, suggesting that few-shot prompting particularly helps the model better recognize more subtle negative emotions that were initially misclassified as joy or anger. In contrast, 31 cases (about 76%) showed no improvement at all; these are often conversational or multi-emotion texts where correctly assigning a single label would require extra context. Finally, 3 cases (about 7%) actually got worse: they evenly spread across anger, joy, and sadness. This may reveal the issue of bias effect, where the small in-context sample nudges the model to overfit to certain lexical patterns and shift some borderline instances to the wrong class.\n",
        "# Overall, the analysis confirms that few-shot prompting can rescue some difficult examples, especially for fear and sadness; but, it does not fix the ambiguous inputs and degrade the performance."

        "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
