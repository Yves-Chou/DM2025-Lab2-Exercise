The `first two phases` refer to the `exercises inside the Master notebooks` of the [DM2025-Lab2-Exercise Repo](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise.git). The `third phase` refers to an `internal Kaggle competition` that we are gonna run among all the Data Mining students. Together they add up to `100 points` of your grade. There are also some `bonus points` to be gained if you complete `extra exercises` in the lab **(bonus 15 pts)** and in the `Kaggle Competition report` **(bonus 5 pts)**.\n",

    "- **Phase 1 exercises:** Need GPU for training the models explained in that part, if you don't have a GPU in your laptop it is recommended to run in Colab or Kaggle for a faster experience, although with CPU they can still be solved but with a slower execution.\n",
    "- **Phase 2 exercises:** We use Gemini's API so everything can be run with only CPU without a problem.\n",
    "- **Phase 3 exercises:** For the competition you will probably need GPU to train your models, so it is recommended to use Colab or Kaggle if you don't have a laptop with a dedicated GPU.\n",
    "- **Optional Ollama Notebook (not graded):** You need GPU, at least 4GB of VRAM with 16 GB of RAM to run the local open-source LLM models. \n",

    "#### 2.1.1 Feature Engineering Steps\n",
    "- **TFIDF**\n",
    "  - I tried TF-IDF features as a baseline, but under the same evaluation metrics the performance was worse than using BERT embeddings, so I kept BERT as the main representation.\n",
    "- **Gemini API**\n",
    "  - I attempted to use the Gemini API (for embeddings), but due to quota limitations it could not be integrated into the final pipeline or fairly evaluated with the same metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.2 Other Models  \n",
    "- **SGD-based linear models**\n",
    "  - I tested additional models with SGD-based linear models. Using the same metrics, their performance was worse than LR / SVM / MLP.\n",
    "- **Bayesian models**\n",
    "   - I also tested additional models with Bayesian models. Using the same metrics, their performance was worse than LR / SVM / MLP.\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter tuning**\n",
    "  - Also, hyperparameter tuning costs too much time relative to the gain, so they were not included in the final report.\n",

    "### 2.2 Mention Insights You Gained\n",

    "- **Final leaderboard scores (same evaluation metric)**  \n",

    "  - Linear SVM — `submission_3_BERT`: **0.6094**  *(best)*  \n",
    "  - MLP — `submission_4_BERT`: **0.5759**  \n",
    "  - Stacking Ensemble — `submission_6_BERT`: **0.5851**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BERT > TF-IDF under the same metrics**  \n",
    "  Using the same evaluation metric, BERT embeddings clearly outperformed the earlier TF-IDF baseline, so all final models are built on BERT features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Imbalance handling is crucial**  \n",
    "  Without oversampling, macro-F1 was dominated by the majority class. After applying `RandomOverSampler`, performance became more balanced across emotions and allowed the SVM model to reach the best score of 0.6094.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Best single model: Linear SVM**  \n",
    "  Given the same features and metrics, Linear SVM provided the highest and most stable leaderboard score, so it is treated as the main model in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensembling is not always better**  \n",
    "  Although I implemented a stacking ensemble (LR + SVM + MLP), its leaderboard score (0.5851) did not surpass the best single SVM model (0.6094). In this setting, ensembling served more as an experiment than a guaranteed improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost–benefit thinking for modeling choices**  \n",
    "  Other options (e.g., more complex models, SGD/Bayesian variants, Gemini API) did not show clear gains under the same metrics and required more compute, tuning time, or quota, so they were not included in the final pipeline and are kept only as experimental notes.\n",
